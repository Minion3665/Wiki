- Trade liberalization: Freeing up trade

# How can we liberalize trade
- Remove trade barriers
	- Remove tariffs to reduce cost of trade
	- Remove quotas to take off a limit
	- By example, the EU does not have any tariffs or quotas, this makes it a great place for businesses!
	- The EU-UK trade agreement does the same thing between the UK and EU
	- The World Trade Organization attempts to administrate trade between countries, helping to make deals that free up trade
