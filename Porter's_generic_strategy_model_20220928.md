# Porter's generic strategy model

<!-- spell-checker:words trailblaze -->

- There are 2 types of companies by this model
  - Low cost operators
  - Differentiating businesses
- You can also be stuck in the middle

- This principle applies _generically_, i.e. not depending on the industry

| Low-cost operators                 | Differentiating businesses     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Charges the lowest prices          | Provides the best advantages   |
| Choosing cheapest suppliers        | Using high-quality materials   |
| Focus on the core product          | Has one or more USPs           |
| Ecommerce to reduce premises costs | High customer loyalty          |
| Focus on waste reduction           | R & D to trailblaze innovation |
| High capacity utilization          | High investment in brand image |
| Capital intensive                  | Highly-trained employees       |
| Flexible workforce                 | Good customer service          |
|                                    | A focus on customer experience |

- If you're in the middle of these, customers do not have a reason to trade with
  you
  - You're providing a subpar service
  - You're not super cheap
  - You're just mediocrity

We can also apply this model narrowly or broadly

|                 | Broad | Narrow |
| --------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Costs           |       |        |
| Differentiation |       |        |

However this is more complex
