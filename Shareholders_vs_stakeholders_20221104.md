# Shareholders vs stakeholders

- Shareholders own shares in a business, meaning they have a financial interest
  in its success
- Stakeholders include shareholders, but also _anyone who is affected by the
  business_, e.g. customers, the government, etc.

| Stakeholder            | Interest                         | Internal/External |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Employees              | Work for you                     | Internal          |
| The board of directors | Make strategy decisions          | Internal          |
| Customers              | Buy your products                | External          |
| The government         | You pay them taxes               | External          |
| Suppliers              | You buy from them                | External          |
| Competitors            | They want your customers         | External          |
| Local community        | Don't want you to damage the env | External          |
| Shareholders           | Want dividends                   | External (mostly) |

- Note particularly that "Competitors" are counted as Stakeholders: even though
  they may be directly antagonistic to the business they are affected by it

- Shareholders are a big part of the stakeholder group
- They don't always want exactly the same thing, but a lot of the time they do
- They would like rewards, normally in the form of dividends
- There are different types of shareholders

| -                               | Ordinary Shares         | Preference Shares |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Can they vote?                  | Yes                     | No                |
| Discretionary?[^1]              | Yes                     | No                |
| Are dividends fixed?[^2]        | No                      | Yes               |
| Return type?                    | Variable                | Variable[^3]      |
| Insolvency investment repayment | After preference shares | If funds remain   |

[^1]:
    Who is paid dividends first/is it at the discretion of the business on
    if/how much to pay?

[^2]:
    If they are unable to pay the business does not have to, but the fixed
    dividends must be paid before ordinary dividends can be?

[^3]:
    Although dividends are fixed for preference shares their return can still be
    variable if the business does not make enough profits to give dividends,
    however if the ordinary shares make _any_ money the preference shares will
    make their fixed dividend
