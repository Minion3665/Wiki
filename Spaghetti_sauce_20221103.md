<!-- spell-checker:words pepsis -->

- There is no "perfect pepsi" there are *multiple* "perfect pepsis"

On Spaghetti sauce:

- Howard did a lot of research, and clustered the data around a few points
- Because *not everyone likes the same thing*
- Previously businesses were looking to get *the best*, but that meant that they
  weren't trying to service anyone apart from the largest group

What did we learn:

- People do not know what they want: you have got to try it out
  - People won't say that they like a milky weak coffee, even if they actually
    do
- There is no good or bad products, only different sorts of products that suit
  different kinds of tastes
- There is no perfect food. You can't please everyone by doing the same thing
- There are no universals when it comes to taste
