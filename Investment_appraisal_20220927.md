# Investment appraisal methods

## Payback

## Average rate of return

## Net present value

- Based on the fact that future cash flows are worth less than the same values
  today
- It's the opposite of compound interest, for example we might _discount_ our
  cash-flow by 10% each year.

### Steps

1. Multiply cash-flow by the discount factor
2. Sum all future discounted cash flows
3. Subtract the initial cost

- The higher the NPV, the better
- Any positive NPV is acceptable, a net present value of lower than 0 is not
  worth investing as you'll lose money

### Practice question

| Cardiff | Net cash flows | Cum net cash flows |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| 0       | -200000        | -200000            |
| 1       | 50000          | -150000            |
| 2       | 60000          | -90000             |
| 3       | 80000          | -10000             |
| 4       | 80000          | 70000              |
| 5       | 70000          | 140000             |

Payback for Cardiff happens after $3\frac{1}{8}$ years, which is 3 years and 1.5
months

ARR for Cardiff is $\frac{\frac{140000}{5}}{200000} = 14\%$

NPV for Birmingham is 53200

| Birmingham | Net cash flows | Cum net cash flows |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|
| 0          | -220000        | -220000            |
| 1          | 70000          | -150000            |
| 2          | 80000          | -70000             |
| 3          | 80000          | 10000              |
| 4          | 70000          | 80000              |
| 5          | 60000          | 140000             |

Payback for Birmingham happens after $2\frac{7}{8}$ years, which is 2 years and
10.5 months

ARR for Birmingham is $\frac{\frac{140000}{5}}{220000} = 12.7\%$

NPV for Birmingham is 54860

#### Which should we choose?

- Financially I'm happier with Birmingham, it has a higher NPV (so the real
- value of money is higher) and it also pays itself back faster. the ARR is lower but
  negligibly so.
