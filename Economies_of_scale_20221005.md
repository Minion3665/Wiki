# Economies of scale

## Internal economies of scale

### Purchasing economies of scale

- When you buy something, it has a cost
- If you buy a lot of stuff, you have more influence as a customer and can
  negotiate better deals with suppliers, reducing your cost per unit

#### Consider: Tesco

- Tesco has various suppliers, and they buy wholesale, allowing them to get
  massive quantities of goods very comparatively cheaply

### Specialization economies of scale

- As labor is divided between workers, workers can focus more on one task
- This allows them to become better at doing that single task, increasing
  efficiency and decreasing unit cost

### Technical economies of scale

- Larger firms have more capital to invest in better technology
- This allows them to increase automation, letting them increase efficiency and
  decrease per-unit costs

### Financial economies of scale

- If you are able to borrow a lot of money, banks and other financial
  institutions will want to work with you as you're a lot less risky of a
  customer
- This means they'll be more likely to provide you favorable interest rates

### Marketing economies of scale

- There's an initial cost to creating an advert (design agencies etc.) but
  playing/displaying it elsewhere only requires buying the space, allowing you
  to reuse a lot of the work and decrease the per-advert cost

### Managerial economies of scale

- Large firms can afford specialist managers who are better at management
- This means they're more likely to make good decisions and be able to manage
  larger areas of the company effectively
- Overall, this reduces unit costs

### Risk-bearing economies of scale

- If a company makes a lot of different things, each of them are likely to have
  different risks
- Therefore, if one thing fails the company is unlikely to go under
- A smaller company may have more reliance on each individual thing they do,
  meaning that they can't do as risky of stuff as they will be in far bigger
  trouble if something fails

### Network economies of scale

- It's hard to set up a network
- It costs almost nothing to have 1 more person using a network
- The person will pay to use the network, making you money and decreasing your
  unit cost

#### Consider: Amazon

- Amazon has massive datacenters over the world, this is very expensive
- Amazon has a complex website, this is very expensive
- A new Amazon customer costs essentially nothing to Amazon, but earns them
  money when they buy something

## External economies of scale

External economies of scale are factors that add to the efficiency of the whole
industry, not just one business.

| External economy of scale         | Example                                                                           | Effect                                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Local labor force increases skill | A college starts a new course                                                     | Lowers costs on training, increases productivity |
| Infrastructure improvements       | A new motorway opens, letting deliveries happen quicker and more fuel efficiently |                                                  |
| Specialist facilities open nearby | A university starts a research lab                                                |                                                  |
