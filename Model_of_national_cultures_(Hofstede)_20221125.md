# Model of national cultures (Hofstede)

## What is it?

- Researched on employees at IBM
- Tried to categorize cultures of different nationalities
- Came up with 6 categories to define national cultures

### Individualism vs collectivism

- Some societies value individuals over teams, in other cultures teamwork is
  seen as far more important
  - UK and USA are both individualist
- This has significant implications for how employees should be rewarded (e.g.
  whether individual or team performance should be rewarded)

### Power distance

- Some societies value authority, bureaucracy, tall org-hierarchies
- Some societies don't, so they have a much smaller distance in power between
  lower employees and higher employees

### "Masculinity" vs "Femininity"

- It's literally not though
- "Masculine" are more competitive, assertive, fact-based
- "Feminine" has more consultation, less aggressiveness, more work/life balance

### Uncertainty avoidance

- How much risk a company wants to take
- Rather than getting new ideas, they want to avoid failure
- This is very bad in some industries such as software development where the
  cost of failure is very small, however perhaps in rocket science it might be a
  bit different
