# Correlation coefficient hypothesis testing

- Only the critical value method is used
- You don't need to know very much for the A-level
- You will have the critical values given to you in the test, normally in a
  table

## Example

$H_0: \rho = 0$  
$H_1: \rho \not = 0$

$n = 20$  
Two-tailed  
$10\%$ significance  
Critical value = $0.3783$

Acceptance range = $(-0.3783, 0.3783)$

As the correlation coefficient is $-0.31$, there is not significant evidence at
the $10\%$ significance level to suggest a correlation between watching TV and
having different results in a reading test.

Therefore, we accept $H_0$ and reject $H_1$
