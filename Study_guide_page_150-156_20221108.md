| Short term shareholders want | Long term shareholders want   |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| A high amount of profit      | A sustainable business        |
| A quick payback period       | To be the best at their niche |

The board of directors is able to make important strategic decisions for the
company.

The chairperson leads the board, as well as reviewing the performance of the CEO
and often planning board activities.

Non-executive directors do not have any control over the company on a day-to-day
basis, however they are invited in to board meetings because of their expertise
(and paid quite a lot).

Shareholder power depends on:

- Whether they are internal or external
- What percentage of shares they have
- What type of shares they have (i.e. can they vote)

1. Founded as a small business in 1945, grew to have 22 plants on 4 continents
   and 750 dealers. They've stayed in the family (passing down MD position from
   father to son)
2. Lord Bamford is the managing director to JCB, which is about as close as you
   can get to being the owner
3. During recession, many construction services are unlikely to be bought as
   they have a very high income elasticity of demand. For example, you're
   unlikely to buy an extension to your house during a financial crisis. This
   will mean that less construction work will be needed, meaning less workers
   and less equipment, affecting the whole industry. JCB makes diggers, so
   companies which would've bought from them may just stay using old diggers, or
   simply not have a need to buy so many diggers during a recession/depression
   stage in the business cycle
4. The owners appear to try to have a long-term view. Lord Bamford's quote up
   there is pretty damning in condemning being "at the whims" of short term
   shareholders, which would suggest he does not want that in JCB
5. They might not just think about the present, but also about the future. For
   example they may consider indicators like net present value rather than
   payback, or take more ethical projects rather than trying to maximize money.
   They'll also try to be the best in the world at making their product, as this
   will likely mean a stable long-term customer base even if it comes at the
   cost right now of more R&D money
6. Being privately owned, Lord Bamford may have more options to use a hunch
   method of decision making, as he doesn't have to directly answer to the stock
   market or a huge body of public investors, and his private investors may
   agree with his goals more and trust him to make decisions. However, he does
   still need to do audits of his decisions and company to make sure that
   they're headed in the right direction, so it's unlikely that all of his
   decisions are made on a hunch

|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shareholders    | Would like to be paid dividends, want the share value to increase |
| Managers        | Would like a good w/l balance and a stable income                 |
| Employees       | "  "                                                              |
| Customers       | Would like a high-quality product with a good value               |
| Suppliers       | Want continued custom from companies, want to make a profit       |
| The state       | Want taxes, want you to follow the law                            |
| Local community | Want you not to destroy the local environment, want jobs          |

## Why are *suppliers* powerful?

- If you have only a few suppliers, then the suppliers have a lot of power (see
  porter's 5 forces)
- Suppliers can raise prices, etc., and there's very little you can do about it
  without changing supplier
- This may affect quality, or be difficult to get the same prices with different
  suppliers

## Debate preparation

"Should the UK government try and foster the growth of a British Mittelstand and
reduce the emphasis on short-termism which is characteristic of UK business"

- Presumably yes, short-termism is a problem for long-term growth
- Caring too much about shareholders and profit may make stuff worse for
  everyone else
- It's possible I'm going to be asked to argue no, I honestly have no idea what
  I'm meant to be writing in this notes section
