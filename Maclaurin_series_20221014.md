# Maclaurin series

- Any function can be written as a polynomial

<!-- -->

- $f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_\infty x^\infty$  
- We can get the first term by setting $x=0$  
- We can get the second term by differentiating the function...  
  $f'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2x + \dots$  
  ...and then setting $x = 0$  
  $f'(0) = a_1 + 0$
- If we continue doing this, we can see that a more general formula is  
  $a_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(x)}{n!}$
