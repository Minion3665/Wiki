# Business assessment reflection record

## Assessment 1

### What can I improve?

- I need to put in more MOPS; I talked hardly at all about competitors,
  long/short-term objectives etc.
- I need to include more application. There is shockingly little in some of my
  answers (including a 4-marker!) which will drop me marks during an exam
- Time-management was an issue. Doing practice questions before the exam may
  better help me stay on track
