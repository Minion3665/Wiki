- Critical path analysis is a project management tool to identify the optimal
  order for project steps (optimizing for time efficiency)

## Dependent vs parallel activities

- Dependent activities rely on another activity that they are _dependent_ on,
  for example you might need to whisk eggs before you can cook them
- Parallel activities can be done in parallel, for example you might be able to
  cook eggs and make toast at the same time

## LFT and EST

- LFT is "Last finishing time"
- EST is "Earliest starting time"

## Float

Float is $LFT - (EST + Duration)$, it's the extra time you have in order to
avoid the project needing to become longer

## Advantages and disadvantages of critical path analysis

| Advantages                                                     | Disadvantages                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lets you see what needs most focus                             | Tasks that aren't seen as important may not get necessary attention |
| Helps you manage your resources and workers assigned to a task | It's hard to redeem yourself from a delay on the critical path      |
| Gives you a measurable way to check you're on target           | Not every task has a fixed duration                                 |
| Lets you see what the shortest way to complete a task is       |                                                                     |
| Relatively simple but clarifies complex decisions              |                                                                     |
| Reduces time redundancy, getting tasks done "just-in-time"     |                                                                     |

One advantage of critical path analysis is that it reduces the redundant time by
letting you see what the shortest way to complete a goal is, ensuring that the
most things possible are completed "just in time". This saves money for a
business as they're not wasting time while completing a project. However this
can also be a disadvantage, as it means that any failure on the critical path can
cause delays in the project's completion, meaning that clients and shareholders
might get upset with you for causing delays if even one thing goes wrong.

A second advantage of critical path analysis is that it allows you to do
effective workforce planning by letting you know what is on the "critical path"
and therefore likely needs more worker attention. Therefore, you can allocate
workers to different tasks based on how much float they have and therefore how
urgent they are. Unfortunately, this doesn't necessarily take into account how
complex tasks are and therefore how many workers they need, which may mean that
critical path analysis could incorrectly convince you to take away necessary
workers from a task, reducing the available workers
