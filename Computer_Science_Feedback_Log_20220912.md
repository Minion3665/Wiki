This is a place for you to record your own personal reflections on your studies, as well as record any other feedback you receive. By taking responsibility for your own development as learners and computer scientists, you have greater understanding of what steps you need to take to continue to develop and you will be better preparing yourself for further independent work in the future.

Each log entry should contain the following information:

- Date logged (This is the date you logged the entry )
- Topic or Task (This gives a quick reference to what the topic or task is that you are reflecting on e.g. "Internet Protocols", "Extended written questions", "OOP in C#")
- Reflection or Feedback (This is where you write the reflection or the given feedback. This should focus both on what went well and what could have gone better e.g. "I understood the question but I did not put down all the things needed for full marks" or "I grasped the concepts in the lesson, but was not happy with the new terminology that was introduced")
- Target Set (From the reflection or feedback, you should set a target which should give a clear action which will address the reflection or feedback. The target should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timebound), e.g. "For the next assessment I will focus my revision on the longer 8-12 mark questions to increase the amount of marks I am awarded for these" or "I will identify and define all key words for a topic before the lessons so that I can better understand the topic and communicate about the topic")
- Date target met (When you review your targets, state the date you think you met your goal and how you could prove it. e.g. "01/10/2022 Scored 19/20 on Assessment" or "14/11/2022 See notes on topic for all key words" If you did not meet the goal, maybe focus on ways that you could meet it if it is still relevant, or write why the goal is no longer relevant)
