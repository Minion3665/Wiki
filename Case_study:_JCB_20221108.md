# Case study: JCB

## General facts

| Stakeholders                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| The family (Shareholders)                                |
| Suppliers in Germany (They don't have English suppliers) |

## Why do they say they're successful

- A focus on being good at what they're good at (their **core competence**[^1])
  - Industrial
  - Agricultural
  - Construction
- Being private rather than public
- Seeing everywhere as their market
- Focusing on value added
  - Having specialists
  - Quality allows you to have a USP
- Low labor content
  - To be profitable your costs have to be very small
  - If you're being humane in your management, you *need* to automate in order
    to keep labor costs low

[^1]: Core competence is the opposite of diversification

## Importance of JCB



## Mittlestands in Britain

TL;DR: We looked for cheaper options

- Lots of them have gone out of business
- Many of them have been taken over by groups who couldn't operate them properly
- We outsourced for cheaper prices rather than focusing on quality
- German companies have a different culture, whereas British companies tried to
  optimize their costs away
