# Mixed practice 22

## Book 1

### Question 5

$H_0: P = 20\%$  
$H_1: P < 20\%$

>

$P(X) \le 2 = 0.04$  
$P(X) \le 3 = 0.1227$

Therefore, the largest acceptance value is 2

### Question 6

$H_0: P=64\%$  
$H_1: P \not = 64\%$

$\frac{64}{100}*180 = 115.2$  
The value of 98 will be on the low-end of the mean

$P(X) \le 98 = 0.0052356$, which is well below the P value of $\frac{5\%}{2}$
which we would need to accept $H_0$,
$\therefore$ we reject $H_0$, accepting $H_1$ and stating that there is a
difference in the proportion of home-owners in Germany

### Question 7

#### Part A

Simple random sampling is selecting members entirely at random from a population

#### Part B

##### Section I

Stratified sampling

##### Section II

As girls and boys are normally split up during sports, this sampling will make
the survey more representative of students who do different types of sports

#### Part C

$H_0: P = 0.4$  
$H_1: P > 0.4$

$P(X > 33) = 0.14$  
$P(X > 34) = 0.09$

Therefore, the critical value is 34 students

#### Part D

9.06% (theoretically 10%)

#### Part E

We accept $H_0$ as there is not enough evidence to conclude an increase in the
proportion of students who play for a school sports team

## Book 2 (exercise 22c)

### Question 5

#### Part A

The 50 countries

#### Part B

$H_0: \rho = 0$  
$H_1: \rho < 0$

>

#### Part C

We reject $H_0$. There is significant evidence at the 5% significance level to
suggest that the amount spent on unemployment support is negatively correlated
with the amount spent on education.

### Question 6

#### Part A

$H_0: p = 0$  
$H_1: P \not = 0$

#### Part B

We reject $H_0$. There is significant evidence at the 5% significance level to
suggest that days being warmer and water usage are correlated

#### Part C

- Correlation is not the same as causation: using more water does not
  necessarily mean days will be hotter
- We tested for correlation, not positive correlation

## Book 2 (mixed practice 22)

### Question 6

C, $P(\bar X < 93.6) = 0.1003$

>

Notwithstanding the mark scheme's belief that I am wrong, I believe it is
actually the book that is wrong as the worked solutions use a value of $1.25$
rather than $25$ as their $\sigma^2$

### Question 7

#### Part A

They are normally distributed

#### Part B

Two tailed

There is evidence at the $5\%$ significance level to reject $H_0$ and suggest
that revising for tests does change your result

### Question 8

#### Part A

- The results of each test must be independent
- The standard deviation needs to remain the same

$P(X \le 31.776) = 0.05$

#### Part B

$P(X \le 37) = 0.2742$

There is not enough evidence at the $5\%$ significance level to reject $H_0$, so
we accept $H_0$ and never clean the kettle again

#### Part C

- The 10 observations each require heating up the kettle. If you don't wait for
  the kettle to cool your observations stop being independent
