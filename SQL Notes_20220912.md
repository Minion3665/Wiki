# A word on casing

- SQL Queries are often written in upper case
- SQL Queries are actually case insensitive (i.e. it's a style thing)

# Basic queries

- `SELECT` gives you items in a table
- `INSERT` adds items to a table
- `UPDATE` updates items in the table
- `DELETE` removes items from the table

## By example...

```sql
SELECT * FROM Table;
```

```sql
INSERT INTO Table (id, name) VALUES (null, 'Skyler');
```

```sql
UPDATE Table SET name = 'Skyler' WHERE name = 'deadname';
```

```sql
DELETE FROM Table where name = 'Skyler';
```

# Modifiers

- `WHERE` only gives you results that match a certain condition
- `LIMIT` only gives you a certain amount of results

```sql
SELECT * FROM Table WHERE name = 'Skyler';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Table LIMIT 1;
```

# Conditions

- `NOT` only gives you results that do not match a condition
- `LIKE` gives you results where a pattern matches
- `=` gives you results that are equal

```sql
SELECT * FROM Table WHERE NOT name = 'Skyler';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Table WHERE name LIKE 'Sky%';
SELECT * FROM Table WHERE name LIKE 'Skyl_r';
SELECT * FROM Table WHERE name LIKE 'Skyl[ae]r';
```

# Sorting

- `ORDER BY` sets columns to order by
- `ASC` orders in ascending order (the default)
- `DESC` orders in descending order

# Joins

- `INNER JOIN` gives you all of the records that match the query
- `LEFT JOIN` gives you all of the records from the table on the left, and
  records that match the query from the table on the right
- `RIGHT JOIN` gives you all of the records from the table on the right, and
  records that match the query from the table on the left
- `FULL JOIN` gives you records from both joined tables

```

```
