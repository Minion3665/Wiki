# Return on capital employed (ROCE)

In the simplest sense, this is *how much money you're getting back scaled by how
much you're investing*, specifically we look at *operating profit*

To calculate it we need figures from both financial statements (the statement of
comprehensive income *and* the statement of financial position)

$\frac{\text{operating profit}}{\text{non-current liabilities + total equity}}$

ROCE is expressed as a percentage

## Examples

If a company made 25,000 in operating profit, with non-current liabilities of
100,000 and total equity of 165,000, they would have an ROCE of **9.43%**

---

We could also calculate the operating profit ourselves, for example a firm that
made 4,500 in revenue with a cost of sales of 1,800 and expenses of 2,000 would
have an operating profit of 700

If that firm then had non-current liabilities of 2,000, share capital of 2,400
and retained profit of 1,200, their total equity would be 3,600 and their ROCE
would be **12.5%**

If the next year the firm's revenue increased by 20%, and their operating profit
margin changed to 18%, they'd have 5,400 in revenue and an operating profit of
972

If that year they had non-current liabilities of 1,800, share capital of 2,400
and retained profit of 1,500, they would have a total equity of 3,900 and their
ROCE would be **17.1%**

---

Finally, we could take another step back and calculate the revenue ourselves. If
a firm sells 650,000 units for 1.25 per-unit, they'll make 812,500. If their
operating profit margin is 15%, they'll have an operating profit of 121,875

If they had a total equity of 1,200,000 and a long-term loan of 600,000, their
ROCE will be **6.77%**

## Interpreting ROCE

- A larger ROCE is obviously better; for example an ROCE of 27.4% would mean
  that for each pound invested we would make 27.4p
- We could consider it in comparison to a bank's interest rates, as if we're not
  getting any more we might want to put it into a bank instead
  - We might want to put it into a bank anyway, as it is likely that investing
    in the business has a significantly higher risk: we should consider if the
    reward is worth it
- We could consider it in comparison to past years' ROCEs, to show us if we're
  getting better or worse at turning investment into cash
- We could consider it in comparison to competitor ROCEs, to show us if we can
  more efficiently turn investment into cash

## Increasing ROCE

- We can increase our operating profit
  - We could increase our revenue
    - We could try to increase our sales
      - We can't directly control this, so it might be difficult
      - We need enough capacity to cope with this
    - We could increase our prices
      - If we increase our prices, we might lose sales (see PED)
  - We could cut our costs
    - If we cut costs, our quality may decrease, meaning higher-quality
      competitors would be favored
- We can decrease the capital employed
  - We could focus on short-term borrowing
    - It might be a challenge to fund large projects via short-term borrowing
    - There might be high interest rates (e.g. overdrafts have a high interest
      rate whereas mortgages have a low interest rate)
  - We could stop borrowing as much money altogether
    - We would need to seek alternative sources of finance or reduce our
      financial needs
  - We could pay off long-term debts
    - The cash we use to pay off the debts can't be spent on anything else, so
      we need to have enough to pay off long-term borrowing and remain
      functioning
