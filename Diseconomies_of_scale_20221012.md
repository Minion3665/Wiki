# Diseconomies of scale

- Economies of scale dictate that as a business gets larger, its unit costs fail
- However, as a business gets bigger, its business costs tend to rise again

## What are the reasons?

1. Employees can feel isolated, and leaders can feel out of touch. This reduces
   morale, decreasing productivity
2. Communication becomes much harder- either as there is a larger span of
   control or a taller organizational structure
   - Employees may lose direction to the business' objectives, leading to a lack
     of direction in the company
   - Leaders can be unaware of what's happening in the business, being unaware
     of initiatives that are not good ideas
   - Work can be duplicated
