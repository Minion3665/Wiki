##### Invest in new machinery

Expected value = $20 * 0.7 + 5 * 0.3$ = £15.5 million
Net gain = $15.5 - 10$ = £5.5 million

##### Increase training budget

Expected value = $0.8 * 8 + 0.2 * 3$ = £7 million
Net gain = $7 - 5$ = £2 million

#### b

$\text{cost} = 4$  
$\text{increased earnings per year} * \text{lifetime of glasses} = 216$  
$\frac{216}{4} = 54 = 5400\% \text{returns}$

Warby Parker should start selling glasses for the low income market. The market
is very large, taking up more than 50% of the total world economic pyramid, and
largely untapped. VisionSpring, a company operating in the market is profitable
as it can make and deliver glasses for very cheaply to small business owners in
the region. Warby Parker already aim to make cheap glasses and believe that
everyone has the right to see (including those with low income) so this new
market is already a market which has glasses made by them. This means that they
could likely successfully integrate into the market as they already have a brand
presence: people who were given free glasses via charities will likely know
about the quality of Warby Parker glasses- a core point of their business model.

Warby Parker could better grow the business by developing a range of contact
lenses. The low-income market requires a high-volume and low-profit-margin
approach as the people buying glasses in that market cannot afford more
expensive glasses. Warby Parker would need to manufacture their glasses very
cheaply, cutting costs wherever possible, meaning that they would find it
difficult to produce their "high-quality" "designer" glasses at the new price
point, requiring them to change focus entirely. Warby Parker already give
glasses to charities such as Sightsavers, which provides their high-quality
glasses free-of-charge to people in developing countries, which given that the
people are likely to be struggling with money anyway and need to see is the more
socially responsible thing to do- an important objective for Warby Parker.

Warby Parker could better grow the business by expanding into the low-income
market. The rate of return for someone buying a pair of glasses from
VisionSpring, a glasses company that operates in developing countries, is 5400%.
This means that although a prospective customer might find it difficult to pay
for glasses initially, as their earnings increased it would be possible for them
to pay for Warby Parker's high-quality glasses. Therefore, Warby Parker could
allow customers to have the glasses on credit, making them significantly more
affordable to people in developing nations. This would likely net them a lot of
customers, letting their business rapidly expand.

Warby Parker could better grow the business by developing contact lenses for the
high-income market. Warby Parker already has existing customers in high-income
countries who care about fashion, as they are buying designer glasses. This
means that customers would be likely to buy their new contact lenses. As contact
lenses last a significantly shorter time than glasses Warby Parker would have
customers repeating orders more often which would increase their revenues. This
increased revenue could be reinvested into expanding even further, perhaps even
to developing nations, whereas given developing nations needing high sales
volumes and low profit margins it's likely that the payback period for the
investment would be longer, meaning Warby Parker would not be able to invest the
money in more expansion for longer.

Overall, Warby Parker could better grow their business by expanding into the
developing market: they already have a brand presence via charities such as
Sightsavers there is significantly less competition for cheap prescription
glasses. This depends on their ability to produce their glasses cheaply enough
to still make a profit, as otherwise their expansion plan will likely fail,
however the most important factor is the fact that there are almost one billion
people worldwide who do not have access to glasses that they need, providing a
large market for Warby Parker to tap.
