# Personal Statement Writing

## 6th-form personal statement

<!-- spell-checker:words lockdown -->

I'm Skyler, a Year 11 student at Chesterton Community College. I'm a
hard-working and precise student who enjoys contributing to discussions. In the
future, I hope to have a career in computer science and possibly run a small
software company.

Since the start of secondary school, I have been enthralled by computers; they
are logical, complicated, and integral to our daily lives. My dream has been to
develop software or hardware for computers that can help people to have more
enjoyable experiences using their devices. In the past, I've developed several
Discord chatbots, one of which has been invited to over two thousand servers. At
the moment, I'm working with a friend to make a fast Fourier transform machine
to display the frequencies of inputted audio on LED strips.

Recently, I've become more interested in companies and how they work. Over
lockdown I made a small business with a few friends selling custom-made
chatbots; it has been fairly successful and we already have a few clients buying
our services. We started slowly but quickly learned how to work well together
and create products that people enjoyed. Although we have had some setbacks and
we are still in the infant stages of creating a company I have high hopes and
look forward to the future with this team.

I've been a newspaper delivery girl since the beginning of Year 10, both on
weekdays and weekends, and used the money that I earned to finance hardware
purchases and save for the future. I have learned how to be reliable and
punctual in this role by arriving on time every day despite the 7 am starts.

During my time at Chesterton, I have taken part in several competitions. One
competition I took part in was Go4SET, which involved designing improvements for
my school. My team designed a better queuing system, which involved using the
devices that each student already has to book time-slots for eating lunch.

The competition I am proudest of is the First Tech Challenge of 2019-2020: a
robotics challenge, in which I was the programmer for our team. Throughout the
competition, I had to work with my teammates, particularly those involved in
hardware or design to complete the project before the deadline. We attended the
regional competition in Duxford, advancing to the second round. We qualified for
the national competition in London, which unfortunately had to be cancelled due
to COVID-19.

In conclusion, I am fascinated by computers and technology, and work hard at
them both in academic study and as a hobby. I look forward to continuing this at
A-level. Thank you for considering my application.
