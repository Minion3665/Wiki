## Long-answer

Sending out an email or a letter to all constituents and using the sample of who
replies is likely to elicit responses of people who really care a lot on the
issue and who want to read letters from the MP, so people from other parties
than the MP may not pay attention, and lots of people who do not care very
strongly may be overridden by a few who do. This is probably opportunity
sampling.
