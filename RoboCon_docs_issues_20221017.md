# RoboCon docs issues

## Servos

- The "Input range" is only mentioned in code comments
- The "Input range" is probably a lie

## GPIO

- WTF is the GPIO input mode thingy?
  - `INPUT_PULLUP` is not used in a code sample
  - `INPUT_PULLUP` is never explained
  - The code sample repeats the 1, so I guarantee that a GCSE student will
    change 1 of the 1s but not both
