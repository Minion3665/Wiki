> Examine the barriers that may have prevented the new corporate culture being
> introduced

- Different words and actions have different meanings in different places
  - Elan means moose in Canada
  - Hari-kiri means loyalty, but also ritual suicide
  - This makes it hard to have a universal culture, as different places will
    interpret your stated values differently
  - The new values had to be created in such a way as to avoid ambiguity between
    cultures, which would have presented significant barrier in their creation
- Implementing a new corporate culture is always difficult
  - While you can change the values you say you have fairly easily, your
    employees' basic assumptions will be more difficult to change
  - The company needed to have staff who would "live" the values
  - Therefore, they had to hire more staff who would behave in relation to their
    values, and explain the values to new staff, as well as remove staff who
    couldn't follow the values from the company
  - This might have made them lose some otherwise good staff who didn't want to
    follow the new values

- Overall, coming up with the new values would be a challenge as they have to be
  universal without crushing the values of the countries and companies they are
  imposed on
- AXA lets individual countries interpret the values, so this may be less of an
  issue than implementing the values as change to a corporation's culture can be
  very difficult and employees may feel that their values no longer align with
  those of the company
