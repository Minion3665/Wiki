# Pros and cons of decision trees

## Pros

- Can give you a good idea of what will get you a better return
- Quite simple to analyze, as you can see each path
- Lets you use probabilities to assign risk rather than having an opaque "this
  will make X money"
- Considers costs and benefits together, so you can see what your returns are
  likely to be alongside E(X)

## Cons

- You only try each thing once. A decision tree might suggest something with a
  high standard deviation, whereas you may want to go with a safer option
- A decision tree does not consider other financial factors, such as cash flow
  (when are you likely to get your investment paid back etc.) so you may want to
  mix it with other investment appraisal methods
- May be difficult to accurately assign probabilities to eventualities
- Ignores qualitative factors
