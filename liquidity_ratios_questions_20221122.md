# liquidity ratios questions

## Sheet 1

### Q1

Debtors = 7.5 - 4.5 - 1.2 = 1.8  
Net current assets = 7.5 - 4.8 = 2.7

### Q2

Total current assets = 5.5 + 1 + 0.4 = 6.9  
Total current liabilities = 1.4 + 2.9 = 4.3  
Current ratio = 6.9/4.3 = 1.60

1.60:1

### Q3

Acid test is current ratio ignoring stock, $\therefore$ it will be the same if
they have stock wasted

Total current assets without stock = 1 + 0.4 = 1.4  
Total current liabilities = 4.3 (from before)  
Acid test ratio = 1.4 / 4.3 = 0.326

0.326:1

### Q4

#### Current ratio

Total current assets = 0.7 + 1.3 + 3.5 + 0.2 = 5.7  
Current ratio = 5.7 / 1.4 = 4.07

4.07:1

#### Acid test ratio

Total current assets without stock = 1.3 + 3.5 + 0.2 = 5  
Acid test ratio = 5 / 1.4 = 3.57

3.57:1

## Sheet 2

### Q1

#### Last year

Stock = 6 - 3.4 - 1.2 = 1.4  
Net current assets = 6 - 4 = 2

#### This year

Cash = 7.1 - 3.4 - 2.5 = 1.2  
Total current liabilities = 7.1 - 0.3 = 6.8  
Creditors = 6.8 - 4.0 = 2.8

### Q2

#### Last year

Current ratio = 6 / 4 = 1.5, 1.5:1  
Acid test ratio = (3.4 + 1.2) / 4 = 1.15, 1.15:1

#### This year

Current ratio = 7.1 / 6.8 = 1.04, 1.04:1  
Acid test ratio = (7.1 - 2.5) / 6.8 = 0.676, 0.676:1

### Q3

This year's CR = 44800 / 28000 = 1.6, 1.6:1  
This year's current ratio is 0.2:1 greater than last year's current ratio

### Q4

#### Last year

Total current assets = 32000 * 1.4 = 44800  
Current assets without stock = 32000 * 1.15 = 36800  
Stock = 44800 - 36800 = 8000

#### This year

Total current assets = 44800  
Current assets without stock = 28000 * 1.2 = 33600  
Stock = 44800 - 33600 = 11200
