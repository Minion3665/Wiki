# Royal Mail forcefield analysis

## Driving forces

- Royal Mail had been privatized, and the new leadership wanted to make
  significant changes
- The government deregulated the market, meaning there was lots more
  competition, so Royal Mail needed to change in order to keep up
- Poor financial performance
  - Had to close many unprofitable branches after they were privatized
  - There was a decline in mail volumes, so there was less of a benefit from
    economies of scale and the "last mile problem" was becoming more of an issue
  - [Royal mail was no longer able to raise
    wages](https://12ft.io/proxy?&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Ffinance%2Frecession%2F5215678%2FRoyal-Mail-warns-staff-to-expect-a-pay-freeze.html)
    which upset their workers, as RM workers were earning less than UK average
    wage

## Restraining forces

- Unions (CWU did not want Royal Mail privatized), and Royal Mail were very
  heavily unionized, so the unions had a lot of power
- RM employees were very uncertain about the changes, as they were aware it
  would cause job losses and they didn't want that
- RM employees were resistant to change as they'd been in the business for a
  long time so the culture was very ingrained
