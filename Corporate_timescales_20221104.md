# Corporate timescales

- Sometimes, we think on the wrong timescale
- A fact might be relevant, but we may dismiss it as we think it's only
  applicable in the short-term
  - As businesses can survive in the short term even without making money, it is
    possible to ignore the fact that a business is losing money until it is too
    late
- Alternatively, we might concentrate too much on the short-term and neglect the
  long-term altogether

## Short-termism

- This is concentrating too much on the short-term and not thinking about
  long-term possibilities
- An example is Primark, which hasn't entered the Chinese fashion market,
  preferring to stay safe in Britain
- This can be because of shareholder pressure, say, as shareholders want a
  consistent upwards trend

## Long-termism and the Mittelstand

- German "Mittelstand" companies are mostly family owned, have humane management
  and a focus on making high-quality long-term products
- They work *really* well, but they don't turn such high shareholder profits as
  they don't focus on the short-term
