<!-- spell-checker:words HMRC,PLCs -->

All business are required by law to keep accurate financial records. By doing
this, it enables them to prepare appropriate financial statements to ensure the
correct amount of tax is paid to HMRC. It also allows a business to monitor its
performance and progress over time and against targets which aids future
decision-making.

One of the financial documents that PLCs must prepare is a statement of
comprehensive income, otherwise known as a profit and loss account. This is a
historic document which shows how a business has performed during a specific
trading period. It details the costs and revenues a business has incurred thus
enabling a business to calculate different types of profit.

Various stakeholders are interested in the statement of comprehensive income and
the different levels of profit a business has made. Their interest depends on
their individual stakeholder objectives.
