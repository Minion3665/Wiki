# Corporate culture

## Culture according to Edgar Shein

- Upper level: visible artifacts
  - E.g. dress-codes, email signatures
- Middle level: less visible espoused values
  - Stated values
  - Determined by management
  - Include formal rules
- Lower level: invisible basic assumptions
  - Hard to change
  - "It's just the way we do things here"

- If values at a lower level are consistent with values at a high level then
  they are true values
- Otherwise, the company will struggle to live by its desired values
