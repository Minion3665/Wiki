- Full backup every 3mo
- Incremental backup every week (from last 3-monthly)
- Incremental backup every day (from last weekly)

- ~500gb/3mo period (out of my ass)
- ~2tb/year
- ~$7.20/mo at $0.0036/mo/gb
- ~£6/mo at current exchange rates

- ~2tb/year
- ~$1.98/y at ~$0.00099/mo/gb for each additional year kept
- ~£1.64/y at current exchange rates

So if we keep 3.5 years of backups...
...we'll pay ~£10/mo which is more than reasonable for the ~7tb of
well-duplicated data we'd be storing
