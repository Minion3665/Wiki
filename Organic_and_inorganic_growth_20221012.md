# Organic and inorganic growth

## Organic growth[^1]

- Organic growth is from internally growing a business using its own resources,
  such as releasing new products, advertising, etc.
- Many businesses simply don't have the money to do anything but organic growth

## Inorganic growth[^2]

- Inorganic growth happens by buying or joining with other businesses

### Mergers

- Shareholders decide that they can be more efficient working together, so they
  merge

### Takeovers

- When a takeover happens, the business that is taking over owns all of the
  assets, rights, etc. that the business they are taking over owns
- Although the business may use old brand names, the old business doesn't really
  exist- it has been consumed by the business that is taking over

### Types of mergers

Note: *Even though these have "merger" in the name, they also apply to takeovers*

#### Vertical forwards merger

- A business might merge with a retailer
- This gives a business more control over sales, e.g. pricing

#### Vertical backward merger

- A business might merge with a supplier
- This gives a business more control over their supply, potentially causing
  cheaper supplies as there doesn't need to be any overhead

#### Horizontal merger

- Rival business decide to integrate
- You have better economies of scale (purchasing on larger scale, more potential
  to hire expert managers etc.)
- You have a larger market share

#### Diversification

- A business takes over something that has nothing to do with it (isn't in the
  same supply chain and isn't a competitor)

### Synergy

- Synergy is the idea that putting stuff together can be worth more than the
  sum of its parts
- This is what business are hoping for when they merge

### Potential problems

#### Cost

- Takeovers can cost a lot of money
- If there isn't good enough synergy, this may not be worth it

#### Regulation

- As mergers can give companies monopolistic power, sometimes they may cause
  extra investigation by government organizations such as the CMA
- Some mergers may even be blocked

#### Culture & HR

- Merging two different company cultures may be difficult to do successfully
  - Some people are likely to feel alienated by the new culture
- Additionally, some people may be no longer needed and lose their jobs to
  redundancy
  - This costs a lot of money in the short term
  - This may cause motivational issues for those who are left
- It's possible some people might need to relocate
  - Some people might not want to

#### Diseconomies of scale

- A much larger economy can cause inefficiencies, e.g. difficulties in
  management, lack of availability of supply, etc.
- This has a negative financial impact on the organization
