# Advantages and disadvantages of investment appraisal methods

## Payback

- Very simple to calculate **but** can be overly simplistic
- Prioritizes early positive returns **but** doesn't tell you about profitability
- Easy to forecast correctly as it cares about the start **but** it doesn't care
  enough about the long-term

## ARR

<!-- spell-checker:words ROCE -->

- Can be easily compared to ROCE **but** doesn't take into account the changing
  value of money over time
- Considers over the lifetime of the project **but** therefore requires
  long-term predictions for long-term projects

## NPV

- Only method that doesn't ignore deprecation of money over time **but** can be
  difficult to predict a discount factor
- Looks at the whole duration of the project **but** therefore requires
  long-term predictions for long-term projects
- Shows you if it's actually worth doing a project based on how much money will
  decrease in value **but** is more difficult to calculate and easier to
  misinterpret

## In general

- Gives us a good quantitative measure to easily compare projects **but**
  entirely ignores qualitative factors
- Helps us judge what we should do in the future **but** relies on potentially
  inaccurate predictions
