# In it together, the beautiful struggle uniting us all (book review)

This is an intentionally public book review. I'm not writing it to be posted on
OBC so I have no requirements for how I should structure it, and no exclusivity
requirements either. However, I will be posting this on Amazon.

For any moderators who may be reading this to check if I am genuinely me: my
name on OBC is Skyler Grey, and my email is skyler3665@gmail.com.

Now, let's deconstruct the book a bit...

## Tone

- It seems really friendly, Scott cracks jokes, talks like he knows you, and
  generally is as I would expect a friend to be
- Scott acts like a mentor, or an excellent teacher, pointing out things and
  giving you time to think about them before moving on. The pacing is on-point
- Scott acts like a professional, he's able to artfully express exactly what he
  means unambiguously, which is a very challenging thing to do
- Scott is accepting: no matter your religion, political beliefs, etc. Scott
  makes a point of avoiding excluding your way of thinking

## Stuff that made me slightly uncomfortable[^1]
